    "Detecting people in images or videos is among the most important components of computer vision and has attracted increasing attention in recent years.  A system that is able to detect human accurately plays an essential role in applications such as autonomous cars, smart surveillance, robotics, and advanced human machine interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem could be addressed in different ways, such as using a neural network, a deep learning framework, or a combination of both.  In this project, we will use the YOLO algorithm to detect humans in images or videos.\n",

    "YOLO stands for You Only Look Once, and it's an algorithm for real-time object detection and recognition in images. The algorithm was proposed by Redmond et. al in a paper first published at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in 2015. The paper won the OpenCV People’s Choice Award.\n",

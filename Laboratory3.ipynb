    "According to the [NVIDIA Jetson documentation](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit). NVIDIAÂ® Jetson Nanoâ„¢ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts. The Jetson Nano could be seen in the following image:\n",
